# Rendercam
A universal render script & camera package for all the common camera types: perspective or orthographic, fixed aspect ratio or unfixed aspect ratio, four options for how the view changes for different resolutions and window sizes, and more.

At the moment everything here seems to work, but it's very messy and I plan to add a lot more features.
